The app's backend is responsible for handling requests, managing data storage and retrieval, and performing server-side processing, while the frontend is responsible for rendering content and handling user interactions. Overall, this web application is a well-designed and efficient solution for managing user accounts and allowing them to participate in problem-solving activities.
